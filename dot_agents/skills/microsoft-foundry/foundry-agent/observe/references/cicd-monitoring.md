# Step 11 — Enable CI/CD Evals & Continuous Monitoring

After confirming the final agent version, prompt with two options:

## Option 1 — CI/CD Evaluations

*"Would you like to add automated evaluations to your CI/CD pipeline so every deployment is evaluated before going live?"*

If yes, generate a GitHub Actions workflow (for example, `.github/workflows/agent-eval.yml`) that:

1. Triggers on push to `main` or on pull request
2. Reads test-case definitions from `.foundry/agent-metadata.yaml`
3. Reads evaluator definitions from `.foundry/evaluators/` and test datasets from `.foundry/datasets/`
4. Runs `evaluation_agent_batch_eval_create` against the newly deployed agent version
5. Fails the workflow if any evaluator score falls below the configured thresholds for the selected environment/test case
6. Posts a summary as a PR comment or workflow annotation

Use repository secrets for the selected environment's project endpoint and Azure credentials. Confirm the workflow file with the user before committing.

## Option 2 — Continuous Production Monitoring

*"Would you like to set up continuous evaluations to monitor your agent's quality in production?"*

If yes, generate a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow (for example, `.github/workflows/agent-eval-scheduled.yml`) that:

1. Runs on a cron schedule (ask the user preference: daily, weekly, and so on)
2. Evaluates the current production agent version using stored test cases, evaluators, and datasets
3. Saves results to `.foundry/results/<environment>/`
4. Opens a GitHub issue or sends a notification if any score degrades below thresholds

The user may choose one, both, or neither.
