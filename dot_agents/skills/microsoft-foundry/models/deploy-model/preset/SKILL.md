# Deploy Model to Optimal Region

Automates intelligent Azure OpenAI model deployment by checking capacity across regions and deploying to the best available option.

## What This Skill Does

1. Verifies Azure authentication and project scope
2. Checks capacity in current project's region
3. If no capacity: analyzes all regions and shows available alternatives
4. Filters projects by selected region
5. Supports creating new projects if needed
6. Deploys model with GlobalStandard SKU
7. Monitors deployment progress

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI installed and configured
- Active Azure subscription with Cognitive Services read/create permissions
- Azure AI Foundry project resource ID (`PROJECT_RESOURCE_ID` env var or provided interactively)
  - Format: `/subscriptions/{sub-id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{account}/projects/{project}`
  - Found in: Azure AI Foundry portal → Project → Overview → Resource ID

## Quick Workflow

### Fast Path (Current Region Has Capacity)
```
1. Check authentication → 2. Get project → 3. Check current region capacity
→ 4. Deploy immediately
```

### Alternative Region Path (No Capacity)
```
1. Check authentication → 2. Get project → 3. Check current region (no capacity)
→ 4. Query all regions → 5. Show alternatives → 6. Select region + project
→ 7. Deploy
```

## Deployment Phases

| Phase | Action | Key Commands |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1. Verify Auth | Check Azure CLI login and subscription | `az account show`, `az login` |
| 2. Get Project | Parse `PROJECT_RESOURCE_ID` ARM ID, verify exists | `az cognitiveservices account show` |
| 3. Get Model | List available models, user selects model + version | `az cognitiveservices account list-models` |
| 4. Check Current Region | Query capacity using GlobalStandard SKU | `az rest --method GET .../modelCapacities` |
| 5. Multi-Region Query | If no local capacity, query all regions | Same capacity API without location filter |
| 6. Select Region + Project | User picks region; find or create project | `az cognitiveservices account list`, `az cognitiveservices account create` |
| 7. Deploy | Generate unique name, calculate capacity (50% available, min 50 TPM), create deployment | `az cognitiveservices account deployment create` |

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see [workflow reference](references/workflow.md).

## Error Handling

| Error | Symptom | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Auth failure | `az account show` returns error | Run `az login` then `az account set --subscription <id>` |
| No quota | All regions show 0 capacity | Defer to the [quota skill](../../../quota/quota.md) for increase requests and troubleshooting; check existing deployments; try alternative models |
| Model not found | Empty capacity list | Verify model name with `az cognitiveservices account list-models`; check case sensitivity |
| Name conflict | "deployment already exists" | Append suffix to deployment name (handled automatically by `generate_deployment_name` script) |
| Region unavailable | Region doesn't support model | Select a different region from the available list |
| Permission denied | "Forbidden" or "Unauthorized" | Verify Cognitive Services Contributor role: `az role assignment list --assignee <user>` |

---

## Advanced Usage

```bash
# Custom capacity
az cognitiveservices account deployment create ... --sku-capacity <value>

# Check deployment status
az cognitiveservices account deployment show --name <acct> --resource-group <rg> --deployment-name <name> --query "{Status:properties.provisioningState}"

# Delete deployment
az cognitiveservices account deployment delete --name <acct> --resource-group <rg> --deployment-name <name>
```
